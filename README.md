All Kinds of C!
===============

This is a repository I created with the intention of filling it up with various little C and C++ programs to help broaden my understanding of the language(s), and get more experience working with a computer's low level API. I want to make little programs that experiment with file editing, file compression, memory management, networking, etc.

"All kinds" is kind of a misnomer, as currently the only section that has anything useful in it is in the data-structures directory, where I have implemented APIs for a Red Black Tree, and a Doubly Linked List. Both are designed to be polymorphic, allowing the data structures to operate on user defined objects.

The programs written are designed to work on Unix/Linux systems, and are located in the UNIX_and_Linux folder
